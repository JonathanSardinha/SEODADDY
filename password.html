			Check your password’s strength easily using this Password Strength Checker by SEODADDY

			Password strength is important because it measures the effectiveness of a password against possible guessing or brute-force attacks. Primarily, it gives you an estimate on how many
			tries an attacker who does not have any idea to the password would need, to guess your password correctly. The strength of a password is normally based on its length, varying
			characters used, and unpredictability.

			Having strong passwords can help lower your risk of a security crack or breach. The speed at which an attacker can submit the guessed passwords to the system is also an important
			factor in determining system security. Some of which would inflict a time-out of several seconds after a few 	failed password entry attempts. In the absence of other possible
			attacks, systems can be secured with fairly simple passwords. However, the system must keep information about the user passwords in some form, and if that information is stolen by
			breaching, then the user passwords can be at risk.

			<h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 600; color: #e8786e;">Why use a password strength checker?</h2>
	  
			<article style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">
				Your internet security is something that you should take seriously. It is equally important as protecting your own home. We are pretty sure that you are not maintaining just one
account – be it an email, social media, cloud, online shopping, membership, and online banking to name a few. You will need a strong password if you want to protect any of these.
Hackers are everywhere, and they have right tools to get access to any account to steal your identity or worse use your bank and credit card details to get all your money. This is
the reason why you need to be cautious and make necessary measures to protect yourself from possible Phishing and other hacking activities.<br>

This Password Strength Checker tool can help strengthen your passwords because we believe that the best way to protect it is by having a password that is unpredictable and extremely
difficult to guess.<br>

Password Strength Checker by SEODADDY can help you assess the strength of your password more accurately. This password strength meter checks the password strength against two
common types of password cracking techniques – the brute-force and the dictionary attack. In addition, it can also analyze the syntax of your password and tells you about its
weaknesses. This password security checker also allows you to make a stronger password from a weak one.<br>

Using this Password Strength Checker by SEODADDY is safe in both the syntax evaluating mode and the dictionary attack mode. As you type your password to the text box its
syntax is analyzed and showed on the client side, by JavaScript in your browser; this means that the password is not being moved over the net and into our server.<br>

The score estimate calculation is usually based on the period that a middle size botnet would probably need in to be able to crack your password if the attacker uses the brute-force
attack. The regular attacker would normally try several times using the most common passwords. Therefore, if your password is included in the list of most common passwords then
your password will probably get a score of 0 because such passwords are very weak.<br>

There are significant attributes of your password that an automatic tool such as this Password Strength Checker cannot evaluate. When creating your password, you should keep in your
mind that it should not have any important information that could be associated with you or the system in which the password is used. Also, avoid the use of the same passwords in
different systems like in your email or social media accounts.<br>
