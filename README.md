There are millions of searches done per day on the internet. Most of the visitors visit the website by clicking on the links available in search engines and believe that the companies found at the top of the results are the best brand in their product, service, and category. Quality of traffic plays a huge role in search engines as web surfers are often misled to a site that is of no interest to them.

If a company or organization aims to get high profit through sales then getting their webpage widely available in the search engine must be a top priority and hence SEO is a must. SEO tools enhance the potential of web pages for high placement on search engine ranking pages. They provide information on backlinks and keywords and hence
once web surfers search for that particular website (through SERPâ€™s) the traffic is increased thus preventing the problem of misleading web surfers.
